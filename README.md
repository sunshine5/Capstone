### Real Estate Data Analysis

**Sima Shah**

#### Executive summary
Fine tune the model to help buyers, sellers and realtors make more informed real estate decisions.

#### Rationale
Why should anyone care about this question? Understanding real estate trends can help realtors, buyers, and sellers make smarter financial choices when working with properties.

#### Research Question
What are you trying to answer? How can real estate market trend analysis be used to predict market demand, property values including buying/selling prices and rental prices?

#### Data Sources
What data will you use to answer your question? I am using a public dataset available on Kaggle called “Housing Price Dataset”. Here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sukhmandeepsinghbrar/housing-price-dataset 

#### Methodology
What methods are you using to answer the question? I used feature engineering using polynomial features, standard scalar, and feature selection techniques. I am also using Linear regression model to get the baseline.

#### Results
What did your research find? Comparing linear regression along with linear regression run combined with polynomial features and feature selection I found that there is improvement in the model performance.

#### Next steps
What suggestions do you have for next steps? Next steps will include exploring the following models (random forest, KNN, and XG boost) and comparing them with the Linear regression results achieved in this exercise.
